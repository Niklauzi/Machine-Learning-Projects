    "   \n",
    "     Breast cancer remains a significant global health challenge. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for improving survival rates and reducing treatment costs. This project aims to classify tumors as malignant or benign using machine learning, focusing on reducing false negatives to ensure timely medical interventions.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   \n",
